            <hr>
            <p id="myProfile">I have had a passion for running since completing my first full marathon, The London Marathon, way back in 2001.
              Since then I have completed one or two marathons per year, breaking three hours approximately ten times, and
              achieving a personal best of 2:39.
              In 2018 I placed 2nd overall in the Japanese Ultra-long Distance Triathlon National Championships.

          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">I had two main goals and one sub-goal coming into this race. The two main goals were:</span>
          </p>
          <ul class="c4 lst-kix_86l9w5evafap-0 start">
            <li class="c3">
              <span class="c0">・Finish under ten hours. &nbsp;As long as the first number was a nine, I&rsquo;d be happy. But a nine, definitely
                not a ten.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="c3">
              <span class="c0">・Overall podium or age-group podium. </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Leading up to the race, I planned a very different nutrition strategy from last year&rsquo;s race. &nbsp;Previously,
              I&rsquo;ve always used a mixture of solids and gels for the first half of the bike, then moving to purely liquid
              or gel-based nutrition from there onwards. &nbsp;This year I adopted a 100% liquid nutrition plan. What that
              meant was 200ml of highly-concentrated, tooth-rottingly sweet Science-in-Sport energy drink and one High-5
              gel each hour of the bike. &nbsp;This equalled just over 200 calories and exactly 60 grams of carbohydrates
              per hour on the bike, which is generally considered to be the most that the average athlete can absorb each
              hour. &nbsp;Whether entirely as a result of this, or whether it was also influenced by other factors, the result
              was a complete lack of the severe stomach cramps that have blighted me during so many of my previous races,
              including last year&rsquo;s.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">After arriving at T1 at something like 5:15am, it was time to get the bike all setup for the race. &nbsp;Bottles
              of the aforementioned fast-track to type 2 diabetes bottles needed to be mixed, tyres pumped up, gels put in
              my bike&rsquo;s &lsquo;bento box&rsquo; and bike computer checking. &nbsp;The bike computer turned out the
              be the first problem of the day. &nbsp;I had changed my bike&rsquo;s speed and cadence sensor battery the previous
              morning, and re-synced it to my computer as Garmin insist (thanks for that, Garmin!). Unfortunately, my rapidly-aging
              and no-longer cool looking (it reminds me of myself!) Garmin 500 decided to pick up the sensor of every other
              athlete in T1. &nbsp;After much cursing, the only solution I could come up with was walking my bike a good
              few hundred metres away from transition where it was out of range of all the other sensors and then resyncing.
              &nbsp;Thankfully, it worked just fine after that. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded losing cadence as I don&rsquo;t
              actually even display it these days, and speed and distance sensing would have worked just fine using only
              GPS, but losing my power reading would have been a major blow for the bike leg. &nbsp;Big sighs of relief all-round
              - well just for me really.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Problem number two presented itself shortly afterwards, when it was time to get wetsuited up before the swim
              warm-up. &nbsp;Many a long-distance triathlete&rsquo;s misery has been prevented or lessened by the liberal
              application of Body Glide or good old-fashioned Vaseline. &nbsp;The back of the neck, where the wetsuit is
              prone to rub, under the armpits and the sackcrack area are favourite spots for lubing. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
              I discovered I&rsquo;d left my lovely roll-on lube stick at the hotel. &nbsp;I managed to get a few fingers
              of Vaseline from another triathlete, but worried about the etiquette of applying someone else&rsquo;s Vaseline
              to my nether region, I opted to just put a bit around my neck. &nbsp; There was some armpit chafing during
              the swim, but thankfully the undercarriage remained intact all day! &nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">The fact that the swim was largely uneventful and stress-free means that it went pretty much as I had planned
              and hoped. &nbsp;My mantra for the swim was: a) don&rsquo;t drown; and, b) find the feet. &nbsp;A is pretty
              self-explanatory, and B just means try to find a swimmer who is just slightly faster than me (finding that
              person never poses a massive problem for a swimmer of my level!) and swim as close as possible behind their
              feet, thereby gaining a draft advantage. &nbsp;Drafting, whilst illegal on the bike leg, is completely legal
              on the swim and run legs. &nbsp;I had hoped for a time of 1:05 for the swim leg, and my Garmin recorded a 1:05:58.
              &nbsp;Coming out of the water into T1, I was happy that it was so uneventful, with an absence of the mid-swim
              punching, kicking and pulling that I&rsquo;ve experienced before. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t waste too much time
              going through T1, but was careful not to rush too much and make any silly mistakes.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">One element of cycling which really appeals to techie/nerdy side of me is the ability to accurately measure power
              output, both for training and racing. &nbsp;Long-distance triathletes generally set a power target of between
              70% and 75% of FTP for the bike leg. &nbsp;Going at a higher percentage, say 80%, will get you a significantly
              faster split but may leave you incapable of running effectively. &nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve heard many times, there&rsquo;s
              no such thing as having a good bike leg followed by a bad run. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s just a bad race! Anyway,
              what that meant was a target power of between 192 Watts &nbsp;and 206 Watts. &nbsp;Jumping ahead of myself
              just for a minute, I finished the bike with an average power of exactly 192W. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d love to say my
              pacing is immaculate, hence the exact result, but I&rsquo;d probably be lying. &nbsp;The bike went as smoothly
              as the swim had done, with the only notable problems being an over-zealous motorbike marshall pointing at me
              as I was passing the fast swimmers during the early stages of the bike, and dropping one water bottle as I
              tried to grab it from an aid station. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have any clear idea of my overall position coming
              off the bike, but I guessed I was somewhere around tenth place. &nbsp;Anyway, I was looking forward to starting
              to chase down some of the people in front of me, in the style that I&rsquo;ve become used to doing. &nbsp;Last
              year, for example, I began the run in 27th place, and ended up finishing 5th overall. &nbsp;Setting your sights
              on the next runner to pass can be incredible motivating, especially as tiredness really begins to creep in
              and your legs get heavier and heavier.

          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">About 1k into the run this usual tactic seemed to be working again as I passed another athlete with whom I&rsquo;d
              had a decent battle on the bike, with him finally getting away from me towards the end as I free-wheeled down
              a hill so I could have a mid-ride pee. I still need to learn how to do this and continue pedalling, but practicing
              it seems to be generally frowned upon! &nbsp;In the back of my mind, I did have a minor sub-goal of finally
              cracking a sub-3 hour marathon leg. &nbsp;After the first 4k of the run I realised that this wasn&rsquo;t the
              day to be attempting that - the near 30&#8451; temperatures made sure of that. &nbsp;Nonetheless, my legs were
              still cooperating quite well with my brain, and I remained confident of putting in a decent run time.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">What quickly started to become clear, and then became crystal clear as I approached the first turn-around point
              at just after 10k, was that I wouldn&rsquo;t be taking my usual approach of picking off plenty of runners during
              the marathon. I only saw 3 runners heading back towards me, which meant that I had started the run in 4th place.
              &nbsp; My pre-race nutrition plan that I had drawn up had me scheduled to start drinking the aid station cola
              from after the halfway turn-around. &nbsp;I was starting to feel pretty fatigued by around 20k, and started
              drinking it just before planned. &nbsp;I generally despise cola, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything that
              tastes or feels as good as cola at this point in an endurance race!</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Given the temperatures, I went for a fast walk aid-station strategy, which went. &nbsp;Scoop of ice water over
              head -&gt; Drink a cup of water -&gt; Drink a cup of cola -&gt; drink a cup of water -&gt; another water over
              the head for good measure. &nbsp;It could be argued that walking through aid stations costs time, but there
              have been plenty of studied that show the time loss is relatively inconsequential, especially when compared
              the the potential time losses from running out of energy or becoming dehydrated.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Over the years, I have favoured two strategies for coping towards the end of tough marathons. &nbsp;One, which
              I used quite well in last year&rsquo;s race, is anger. &nbsp;Basically yelling at myself, and calling myself
              every four-letter word under the sun to discover my inner angry beast mode. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s never pretty,
              and it looks even worse in the race photographs, but it works for me - sometimes. &nbsp;The other strategy
              is a zen-like calmness, where I simply focus on getting to the next kilometre marker without any other thoughts
              really entering my head. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never consciously chosen either strategy, but one of them generally
              manifests itself. &nbsp;Today was a day for the much calmer approach. &nbsp;</span>

          <p class="c1">

          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">At the final turn-around point, at something like 30k, I could see that I had put time into the runner behind
              me, and started to feel confident about maintaining my position, although I knew that I was unlikely to catch
              the runner in front of me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d calculated that I was now in second place, although I found that
              hard to believe and almost discounted it and put it down to my brain playing tricks on me. &nbsp;That relative
              confidence did nothing to help prevent that final ten kilometre stretch from feeling like the longest forty
              minutes of my sporting life, where time and distance seemed to stand still. &nbsp;But step by step, every-so-slowly,
              the kilometre markers passed by, taking me closer to the goal - the goal that I have visualised during so many
              of my harder training sessions over the preceding nine months. &nbsp;Having made it as far as the turn into
              the finish chute without any major cramps, my hammies decided to cramp up with just a few hundred metres to
              go. &nbsp;</span>

            <span class="c0">Anyone who knows me knows that I&rsquo;m not a shouter, but during those final steps down the finish chute, the
              raw emotion just flows out of my body. Emotion generated by ten hours of hard work and concentration, but more
              than that, emotions stemming from nine months of hard training, from the countless sacrifices made during that
              time, of the time spent reading Slowtwich forums (other forums are available!), of the late-night four-hour
              turbo trainer sessions finishing at 1 or 2am, then waking up at 6am to take care of family, of long runs in
              the driving rain when all you want to do is sit on the sofa and binge-watch your current Netflix favourite,
              of late-night swimming sessions in the pool with the woman who smells of insect repellent. &nbsp;The emotion

              T2) got an me the fourth best bike split of the day, compared with only 26th fastest last year. &nbsp;Less
              impressive, as always, was my swim time of 1:05:31, which was only 68th overall. &nbsp;However, given that

          <h3>Kyushu Sekiryo Trail Run in Yamatocho 2018 Race Report</h3>
          <p>I knew it had been quite a few years since I had done this race, but I didn’t know how many.  Facebook helpfully informed me that it had in fact been eight years since I did the race.  I’d like to think that I’ve improved significantly as a trail runner during that time, especially during the last two years when I’ve been running trails regularly two or three times a week.  And in all honestly, eight years ago I had precisely zero ability as a trail runner, so some improvement shouldn’t have been too hard to come by.  Eight years ago I was also terrified by the prospect of a 35k trail race with more than 2000m of ascending.  These days I generally feel unruffled before any race, with the exception of  my yearly A-race or two.
            Anyway, after a luxurious night of car camping in the race car park, I woke feeling refreshed and ready for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bang went the starter’s cannon (ok, more of a pop from a toy pistol) and we started running comfortably on a road section to the start of the trails, with me pottering along in around 15th position or so.  Problem number one arrived much sooner than anticipated, when we were directed onto a trail at around the 2km mark. Somehow - and I still don’t know how - we all missed a turn and ending up scrambling through a fallen bamboo forest, climbed over and squatting under fallen bamboo trees.  The general feeling in the group was that we must have missed a sign, and sure enough any semblance of a trail soon disappeared.  When we stopped and turned around, it was clear that most of the other runners had also missed the turn.  Most likely, the turn wasn’t marked, or we were directed onto the trail one turn too soon.  Anyway, after a five-minute scramble up a wooded slope, we were back on the road, and looking forward to the trails.  One of the joys of trail running!
        </p> 
        <p>
            After climbing around 1000m in the next 10k or so, I was ready to put my new descending skills to the test.  All was going swimmingly for a few ks, until I took the first of many falls.  The first one was a classic superman-esque affair, going close to full tilt down a perfectly innocuous easy slope.  Very little damage was done unfortunately, although more unfortunate was that no other runners were nearby to witness my incompetence!
            
            I followed this with at least another 5 or 6 falls.  A bad workman always blames his tools, and in this case I’m laying the blame squarely at the feet of my Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed shoes.  When new - just a mere 3 months ago - they had the best grip of any shoe I’ve ever used. Just three shorts months later, the sole lugs have worn down quite noticeably.  That’s my excuse anyway, and I’m sticking with it.  Anyway, to cut a long story short, and to word it in a way any other 1990s teenagers would get, I got up that day more than Chumbawamba did in Tubthumping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climbing the ski slope at Gokase and beginning the long descent back to the start marked the start of the technically most difficult part of the course for me.  A stretch of about 4km of loose rocks covered by grass and weeds - i.e. basically hidden rocks - proved to be very hard work for a runner of my trail running ability.
            
            A nice (for me) fast road descent, interspersed with slow and crampy (again, for me!) trail sections took me back to the finish line, and a finish time of 4:55:02, 9th place overall and 5th in the old buggers over 40s men category.  The winner was an astounding one hour and fifteen minutes faster than me.  There’s still a long way to go to become a better trail runner, and if I’m honest with myself, I’m never going to be an especially good trail runner.  But as a great aside during the triathlon off-season and way to build strength in my running legs, it’s something I’ll continue to enjoy doing.  I might even continue to test myself with the occasional race!

          <h2>Stingy northerner's guide to getting fast on a bike</h2>
          <p>You can take the man out of Yorkshire, but you definitely can’t take the Yorkshire out of the man. That’s right, I’m stingy!  Proper stingy.  When you look round a triathlon transition area - even a minor local event - you often see bikes that cost upwards of $5000 (about £4000 or ￥550,000).  Those prices just don’t sit well with my parsimonious nature, so how do you get to be competitive in the bike leg of a triathlon on a bike that’s good enough to get you going fast without breaking the bank? Read on and find out.</p>
          <p>Let’s get down to details, starting with the bike then working down from head to feet.</p>
          <h3>Bike and Frame</h3>
          <p>I’ve had my bike since the summer of 2012, when I bought it just after finishing my first Ironman-distance race on a traditional road bike and realising that it just wasn’t up to the job.  I chose an ‘entry-level’ <a href="http://2012.feltracing.com/USA/2012/TT-TRI/TT-TRI-Series/B16-.aspx">Felt B16</a> triathlon bike.  Nothing too fancy, but just a nice blank canvas to build upon.  I have tinkered with it and replaced (in many cases re-replaced) parts in a bid to make it as fast as possible.
            You could draw parallels to Trigger’s Broom Paradox, and you’d be right!</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAh8HryVaeY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>The Felt B16 frame is largely the same shape as used by a number of professional racing teams in the late noughties.  If it was good enough for pro riders then, it’s certainly not going to be holding me back now.  And if it didn’t crumble under a juiced-up noughties pro with an FTP of well over 5.5W/Kg, it should stand up to my paltry 4.2W/Kg.  Okay, I know . . . different carbon lay-ups and weaves, etc., etc.  But when it comes down to it, it’s stiff enough and it’s certainly aero enough for me.  As a <a href="https://www.slowtwitch.com/Tech/Triathlon_Bikes_in_the_Age_of_Peak_Aero_6429.html">wind tunnel study </a>published on Slowtwitch.com showed last year, triathlon bikes have reached a level of peak aero, and given a good position and setup, gains from ‘faster’ frames are minimal.  My one and only complaint with the bike is with the rear brake.  Yes, hiding the brake out of the wind behind the crank is aerodynamic, but it is a real pain in the arse to adjust</p>
          <img src="img/FeltB16.jpg" alt="2012 Felt B16">
          <h3>Wheels</h3>
          <p>
            The quote “Aero, light and cheap. Choose two.” is often thrown around when choosing which wheels to buy. The common misconception is that a lighter wheel is a better wheel.  Luckily, the guys at Flo Cycling have <a href="http://flocycling.blogspot.com/2014/01/flo-cycling-great-debate-aero-vs-weight.html"> debunked that myth</a> and showed that aero is far more important than weight, even on hilly courses.  So, I chose aero and cheap!  Luckily, Flo also sells great value wheels. I chose the Flo 30s.  Now, they’re not all sexy and carbon, just good old-fashioned aluminium.  But they are pretty aerodynamic, strong and relatively cheap.  One of my race prizes this year was a Christiano Ronaldo muscle machine!  You know the thing: sit on the sofa, drink beer, eat crisps, strap the machine to your biceps, and by the time you’ve finished binge-watching Netflix you’ll have the biceps of a Greek god.  Right, it’s nonsense, so I sold it and bought a very lightly used Flo 60 front wheel with the proceeds.  More free speed, and especially useful as I’m planning on racing a flat Ironman course next year, where aerodynamics will be more important.  I’m still looking at the best way to procure a rear disc wheel...watch this space.
          </p>
          <h3>Helmet</h3>
          <p>
              The most effective way to ‘buy’ speed is almost certainly with an aero helmet.  They come in all shapes and sizes, from comically long-tailed to snub-tailed to bowling ball shaped.  They do, however, all have one thing in common - they’ll make you look like an idiot. An idiot, but a fast idiot!  My helmet of choice for the last few years is the <a href="https://www.bellhelmets.com/en_ap/javelin-18"> Bell Javelin</a>.  In wind tunnel studies and triathlon forum threads, it rarely tests the fastest for any rider, but it does usually test pretty well for every rider.  Helmets are very individual, both in terms of how they affect your aerodynamic properties and how they fit your head.  Having a ridiculously-shaped peanut head, the latter is particularly problematic for me.  I have no access to a wind tunnel, but it looks pretty fast and absolutely absurd, so it must be fast.  It’s also predominantly black, and as everyone knows, black is the fastest colour!  I am looking to upgrade to a <a href="https://www.giro.com/as_en/aerohead/"> Giro Aerohead </a>at some point in the near future as studies have shown that it tests fastest or almost fastest for most riders. 
          </p>
          <h3>Base Bar and Extensions (i.e. Handlerbars!)</h3>
          <p>
              My Felt Rocket (Frocket?!) came with a distinctly non-aero base bar.  My upgrade for this has to go down as one of my best stingy purchases. The <a href="https://profile-design.com/products/svet-r-1"> Profile Design SVET R Carbon basebar </a> is pretty light and fast, and wouldn’t look out of place on a much higher spec bike than mine.  A seller on Amazon US had a stonking deal, as long as you didn’t mind a white bar.  The black ones were selling for around $250, whereas a white one was just $60.  Hmm, let me think about that for a second.  I’d have happily bought a fluorescent pink bar for that price!  My existing aerobar extensions were still perfectly usable, and almost as light as fancy carbon ones costing a few hundred dollars, so they got reused with the very adjustable Zipp Vuka Alumina Clip mounting system.
          </p>
          <h3>Saddle</h3>
          <p>
              There’s a time to save money, and a time to spend money.  If saving money means that your meat and two veg lose all feeling when you go on a long ride, it’s time to spend some money. ISM saddles have a dual-pronged nose which relieves pressure on your ‘delicate’ areas, and eliminates numbness down there.  It cost a bit, but it was money well spent.  Helpfully, it also allows me to rotate my pelvis forwards more than a regular saddle, which helps with getting down and staying down in the aero position.
          </p>
          <h3>Power Meter</h3>
          <p>
              Power meters make you faster, period.  Ok, that might not actually be true. But in the same way that smart use of a heart-rate monitor can make you a faster runner, smart and consistent use of a power meter will definitely make you a better and faster cyclist.  Used in conjunction with TrainerRoad (details next), I have quantifiably become a 25% better cyclist than I was  just over two years ago.
              There is some debate about whether a power meter should always measure the power output of each leg individually, or if just measuring the output of one leg (usually the left) and doubling the number is sufficient.  As you might have guessed, the single-leg variety is cheaper, and thus that is the one I bought.  It was good enough for Team Sky, so it’s fine for a muppet like me!  It’s been rock solid and worked without any problems whatsoever for the last two years.          
          </p>
          <h3>TrainerRoad</h3>
          <p>
              The only product or company in the world I would ever be a Fanboy for is <a href="https://www.trainerroad.com"> TrainerRoad</a>.  Run by a great team in Nevada, it’s a bike training application with one goal - to make you a faster cyclist.  I began using it about 5 or 6 years ago before I had a power meter using their ‘Virtual Power’ feature.  That worked well enough, but when paired with a power meter (or smart trainer, or both), it really comes into its own.  There are numerous plans included in the subscription cost, taking you through the periodization training phases, known as ‘base - build - specialty’ within TrainerRoad.  Is it hard work?  Yes.  Could I happily strangle their head coach when the workout text pops up informing me that I have just one more effort to go, and let’s make it the best one yet?  Absolutely, yes!  Has it made me a faster cyclist? Without a shadow of a doubt, yes.  

              I would go as far as to say that it has been the single most important investment in my progress as an athlete.  A heart rate monitor helped me a lot back when I was a beginner runner, mostly as a tool to ensure that I didn’t push myself too hard.  TrainerRoad makes sure that I do that when necessary, but, bloody hell, it doesn’t half make me work hard when I need to.
              
              If you want to be a better cyclist, you need to at least try TrainerRoad.  A lot of people are still resistant to the idea of indoor bike training, generally because they claim it’s too boring.  I suspect the real reason is that it’s much harder than outside riding, and a lot of people just don’t want to embrace the pain.
          </p>

          <p>          
              As stated previously, my Functional Threshold Power (FTP) - very roughly equating to the maximum power level I can output consistently for one hour before I’d fall of the bike in a state of complete exhaustion - has increased from 220W in September 2016, up to a peak of 275W in May 2018.   It’s currently sitting at 260W as I focus on marathon training and use TrainerRoad twice a week purely to maintain my bike fitness.
              
              As well as making you a better person(!), it will also provide endless entertainment for your better half (wife for me) as she watches you literally crawl out of your pain cave on your hands and knees after completing the FTP test.
              
              What makes this stingy northerner especially happy is that I’m ‘grandfathered in’ at the same annual subscription price I paid as an early adopter.  Just subscribe - you’ll be glad you did as you fly past people on the bike leg of your next triathlon!
              
          </p>
          <h3>Shoes</h3>
          <p>
              After reading a <a href="http://www.thomasgerlach.com/2016/05/fastest-ironman-bike-shoes-aerodynamics.html"> great blog from Thomas Gerlach </a>about taking a high-end pair of lace-up bike shoes and modifying them for triathlon, I was keen to try the same thing. At $200+ though, I wasn’t so keen on the price tag of his chosen shoes.  Luckily I found the <a href="https://garneau.com/us_en/signature-84-cycling-shoes-1487254"> Louis Garneau Signature 84 </a>shoes on Amazon US for a mere $60 including shipping to Japan.  Again, they’re not quite as light, and they’re possibly not quite as stiff (though that’s an almost impossible thing to quantify), but in most other ways they’re extremely similar.  I removed the laces and replaced them with elastic shoe bands, and they’re extremely comfortable and relatively easy to get in and out of.  With my focus being on long-course racing, I don’t need to do flying mounts, which means I don’t have to get my feet into the shoes when I’m already cycling along.  This meant I could leave the tongue in place; short-course racers might want to consider cutting out the tongue for ease of entry.

          <h3>Hydration</h3>
          <p>
              In the last five years or so, the terms BTS and BTA (Behind The Saddle and Between The Arms, respectively) have become key phrases relating to the fastest locations to store your hydration or liquid nutrition on the bike. For both varieties, there are dozens if not hundreds of products designed to provide the best way to mount a bike bottle in these locations.  Personally I have found that one bottle cage zip-tied between the aerobar extensions and another one zip-tied behind the saddle solves the problem perfectly adequately.  A big win at just a few hundred yen for a large bag of zip-ties.  Every cyclist seems to have a cupboard full of spare bottle cages, so no extra expense there. Who knows where they come from - maybe they breed in there!              
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

              Hopefully I’ve shown that you don’t have to spend the earth in order to build a bike that is capable of doing justice to your ability as a cyclist.  Up-to-date cycling technology and parts always seems to attract a premium price here in Japan, and technology seems to lag behind in general (don’t ask me how many ‘superbikes’ I’ve seen paired to a 15 year-old CatEye bike speedo!), so my journey has been heavily dependent on international variants of Amazon (most the US) and eBay. I have been careful though to maintain a good relationship with my local bike shop (LBS in internet forum parlance). <a href="http://jitenshajin.com/"> サイクリスト </a>is an absolute legend, and provides great support every time my amateur wrenching efforts require a professional resolution!
          </p>
          <p>
              At the end of the day, go ahead and spend whatever money you’re happy spending on the goal of getting faster on the bike. Just remember that whilst it is possible to buy speed, the one thing you can’t buy is a faster engine.  Spend the time and money on your ‘engine’, get a rig that will do justice to that engine, and you’ll love flying past ridiculously expensive superbikes in your next race.

                Marathon runners like to be ‘sub’-something.  Sub-4, sub-3, even sub-5, but sub-something!  With my last open marathon being back in 2016, it’s been a long time since I’ve been able to put myself into any of those categories.  If you’re only as good as your last race, from my triathlon marathon last year I can only say I’m a sub-3:15 runner.  I have no plans to do either one in the immediate future, but at nearly 42 years old a 3:11 wouldn’t quality me for London or Boston.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another thing marathon runners love is PBs.  Breaking them mostly, but when we’re no longer capable of breaking them, we like to gaze longingly at those distant entries on Garmin or Strava and reminisce about faster times.  I’ve grudgingly accepted that the days of breaking my 10k PB are quite possibly over, but I haven’t been able to escape that nagging doubt - right at the back of my mind - that I’m still capable of banging out a new marathon PB. My best currently stands at 2:42:31 from back in the 2015 Kumamoto Castle Marathon.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal, which I stupidly chose to accept, is to attempt to improve on that time in this year’s race.  Whereas in the past I would be quite cagey about race goals and generally keep them to myself, these days I’m quite happy to put them out there.  I’m a runner: I set ambitious goals which I turn myself inside out to try to achieve.  I’m proud of my moderate ability which I’ve built through years of inconsistent training and inadequate rest and nutrition.  I’m not ashamed of a few failures along the way.  Having said that, I won’t fail. Probably.  Neither am I ashamed any more of wearing obscenely short shorts to a race.  If you don’t like seeing my arse cheeks practically falling out of my shorts when I run, either don’t look or pass me.  The choice is yours!            
              </p>
              <p>
                Which brings me back to the desire to be sub-something.  If I can grind out a 2:42:30 I would have a new PB.  But isn’t that just too tantalisingly close to 2:40 to ignore?  Wouldn’t it be better to try to break a nice round number than shave a few random seconds off a mediocre PB?
              </p>
              <p>
                A pace of 3:45 per kilometre would bring me home in 2:38:13.  3:52 pace would take me to my current best time.  3:47 pace and I would just sneak in under 2:40.   So the question is, which should I chose?  I’ve done plenty of training ks at 3:45 pace in preparation for the race, so I feel relatively confident I can maintain it for the duration of the race.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can see reasons on both sides of whether it’s possible or not:
              </p>
              <h3>Positives</h3>
              <p>
                - Marathons hold no fear for me any more.  Spending the last 3 or 4 years focussing on Ironman-distance racing has changed my perspective about what constitutes a long day.<br>
                - I’ve done three runs over 30k in training since December, two of which included lengthy periods at marathon pace.  Three other long runs of 28k or thereabouts should mean my body is used to the distance coming into the race.<br>
                - During my Christmas and New Year break at my folks’ place in Spain, I got in some good quality running - pacey 5ks, 20k+ endurance runs, fast Strava segment-bagging, hills, etc.<br>
              </p>
              <h3>Negatives</h3>
              <p>
                - I’m four years older than when I set my PB.  I’m also four years wiser, but four years on the body is four years!<br>
                - My preferred race-day choice of nutrition, High5, is currently inexplicably stuck in customs in Fukuoka. I’ve bought some backup gels here in case they don’t appear in the next week, and I’ve got time to use some of them in training, so fingers crossed it shouldn’t be such a big deal.<br>
                - Weight. I’m still just over a kilogram heavier than what I consider my best marathon weight.  I don’t think it’s excess body fat, rather additional muscle mass from cycling and swimming that I seem to have developed since my last open marathon (not that anyone would notice, mind you.)<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                To sum up, I’m ready and raring to go; ready to push my body to see what it can still achieve.  Ready to embrace the joy if all goes according to plan, but equally ready to learn from anything that doesn’t go according to plan.
