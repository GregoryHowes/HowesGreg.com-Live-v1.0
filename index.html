            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I have had a passion for running since completing my first full marathon, The London Marathon, way back in 2001.
              Since then I have completed one or two marathons per year, breaking three hours approximately ten times, and
              achieving a personal best of 2:42.
              In 2018 I placed 2nd overall in the Japanese Ultra-long Distance Triathlon National  Championships.

          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">I had two main goals and one sub-goal coming into this race. The two main goals were:</span>
          </p>
          <ul class="c4 lst-kix_86l9w5evafap-0 start">
            <li class="c3">
              <span class="c0">・Finish under ten hours. &nbsp;As long as the first number was a nine, I&rsquo;d be happy. But a nine, definitely
                not a ten.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="c3">
              <span class="c0">・Overall podium or age-group podium. </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Leading up to the race, I planned a very different nutrition strategy from last year&rsquo;s race. &nbsp;Previously,
              I&rsquo;ve always used a mixture of solids and gels for the first half of the bike, then moving to purely liquid
              or gel-based nutrition from there onwards. &nbsp;This year I adopted a 100% liquid nutrition plan. What that
              meant was 200ml of highly-concentrated, tooth-rottingly sweet Science-in-Sport energy drink and one High-5
              gel each hour of the bike. &nbsp;This equalled just over 200 calories and exactly 60 grams of carbohydrates
              per hour on the bike, which is generally considered to be the most that the average athlete can absorb each
              hour. &nbsp;Whether entirely as a result of this, or whether it was also influenced by other factors, the result
              was a complete lack of the severe stomach cramps that have blighted me during so many of my previous races,
              including last year&rsquo;s.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">After arriving at T1 at something like 5:15am, it was time to get the bike all setup for the race. &nbsp;Bottles
              of the aforementioned fast-track to type 2 diabetes bottles needed to be mixed, tyres pumped up, gels put in
              my bike&rsquo;s &lsquo;bento box&rsquo; and bike computer checking. &nbsp;The bike computer turned out the
              be the first problem of the day. &nbsp;I had changed my bike&rsquo;s speed and cadence sensor battery the previous
              morning, and re-synced it to my computer as Garmin insist (thanks for that, Garmin!). Unfortunately, my rapidly-aging
              and no-longer cool looking (it reminds me of myself!) Garmin 500 decided to pick up the sensor of every other
              athlete in T1. &nbsp;After much cursing, the only solution I could come up with was walking my bike a good
              few hundred metres away from transition where it was out of range of all the other sensors and then resyncing.
              &nbsp;Thankfully, it worked just fine after that. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded losing cadence as I don&rsquo;t
              actually even display it these days, and speed and distance sensing would have worked just fine using only
              GPS, but losing my power reading would have been a major blow for the bike leg. &nbsp;Big sighs of relief all-round
              - well just for me really.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Problem number two presented itself shortly afterwards, when it was time to get wetsuited up before the swim
              warm-up. &nbsp;Many a long-distance triathlete&rsquo;s misery has been prevented or lessened by the liberal
              application of Body Glide or good old-fashioned Vaseline. &nbsp;The back of the neck, where the wetsuit is
              prone to rub, under the armpits and the sackcrack area are favourite spots for lubing. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
              I discovered I&rsquo;d left my lovely roll-on lube stick at the hotel. &nbsp;I managed to get a few fingers
              of Vaseline from another triathlete, but worried about the etiquette of applying someone else&rsquo;s Vaseline
              to my nether region, I opted to just put a bit around my neck. &nbsp; There was some armpit chafing during
              the swim, but thankfully the undercarriage remained intact all day! &nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">The fact that the swim was largely uneventful and stress-free means that it went pretty much as I had planned
              and hoped. &nbsp;My mantra for the swim was: a) don&rsquo;t drown; and, b) find the feet. &nbsp;A is pretty
              self-explanatory, and B just means try to find a swimmer who is just slightly faster than me (finding that
              person never poses a massive problem for a swimmer of my level!) and swim as close as possible behind their
              feet, thereby gaining a draft advantage. &nbsp;Drafting, whilst illegal on the bike leg, is completely legal
              on the swim and run legs. &nbsp;I had hoped for a time of 1:05 for the swim leg, and my Garmin recorded a 1:05:58.
              &nbsp;Coming out of the water into T1, I was happy that it was so uneventful, with an absence of the mid-swim
              punching, kicking and pulling that I&rsquo;ve experienced before. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t waste too much time
              going through T1, but was careful not to rush too much and make any silly mistakes.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">One element of cycling which really appeals to techie/nerdy side of me is the ability to accurately measure power
              output, both for training and racing. &nbsp;Long-distance triathletes generally set a power target of between
              70% and 75% of FTP for the bike leg. &nbsp;Going at a higher percentage, say 80%, will get you a significantly
              faster split but may leave you incapable of running effectively. &nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve heard many times, there&rsquo;s
              no such thing as having a good bike leg followed by a bad run. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s just a bad race! Anyway,
              what that meant was a target power of between 192 Watts &nbsp;and 206 Watts. &nbsp;Jumping ahead of myself
              just for a minute, I finished the bike with an average power of exactly 192W. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d love to say my
              pacing is immaculate, hence the exact result, but I&rsquo;d probably be lying. &nbsp;The bike went as smoothly
              as the swim had done, with the only notable problems being an over-zealous motorbike marshall pointing at me
              as I was passing the fast swimmers during the early stages of the bike, and dropping one water bottle as I
              tried to grab it from an aid station. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have any clear idea of my overall position coming
              off the bike, but I guessed I was somewhere around tenth place. &nbsp;Anyway, I was looking forward to starting
              to chase down some of the people in front of me, in the style that I&rsquo;ve become used to doing. &nbsp;Last
              year, for example, I began the run in 27th place, and ended up finishing 5th overall. &nbsp;Setting your sights
              on the next runner to pass can be incredible motivating, especially as tiredness really begins to creep in
              and your legs get heavier and heavier.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">About 1k into the run this usual tactic seemed to be working again as I passed another athlete with whom I&rsquo;d
              had a decent battle on the bike, with him finally getting away from me towards the end as I free-wheeled down
              a hill so I could have a mid-ride pee. I still need to learn how to do this and continue pedalling, but practicing
              it seems to be generally frowned upon! &nbsp;In the back of my mind, I did have a minor sub-goal of finally
              cracking a sub-3 hour marathon leg. &nbsp;After the first 4k of the run I realised that this wasn&rsquo;t the
              day to be attempting that - the near 30&#8451; temperatures made sure of that. &nbsp;Nonetheless, my legs were
              still cooperating quite well with my brain, and I remained confident of putting in a decent run time.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">What quickly started to become clear, and then became crystal clear as I approached the first turn-around point
              at just after 10k, was that I wouldn&rsquo;t be taking my usual approach of picking off plenty of runners during
              the marathon. I only saw 3 runners heading back towards me, which meant that I had started the run in 4th place.
              &nbsp; My pre-race nutrition plan that I had drawn up had me scheduled to start drinking the aid station cola
              from after the halfway turn-around. &nbsp;I was starting to feel pretty fatigued by around 20k, and started
              drinking it just before planned. &nbsp;I generally despise cola, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything that
              tastes or feels as good as cola at this point in an endurance race!</span>
          </p>
          <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0"></span>
          </p>
          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Given the temperatures, I went for a fast walk aid-station strategy, which went. &nbsp;Scoop of ice water over
              head -&gt; Drink a cup of water -&gt; Drink a cup of cola -&gt; drink a cup of water -&gt; another water over
              the head for good measure. &nbsp;It could be argued that walking through aid stations costs time, but there
              have been plenty of studied that show the time loss is relatively inconsequential, especially when compared
              the the potential time losses from running out of energy or becoming dehydrated.</span>

            <span class="c0">Over the years, I have favoured two strategies for coping towards the end of tough marathons. &nbsp;One, which
              I used quite well in last year&rsquo;s race, is anger. &nbsp;Basically yelling at myself, and calling myself
              every four-letter word under the sun to discover my inner angry beast mode. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s never pretty,
              and it looks even worse in the race photographs, but it works for me - sometimes. &nbsp;The other strategy
              is a zen-like calmness, where I simply focus on getting to the next kilometre marker without any other thoughts
              really entering my head. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never consciously chosen either strategy, but one of them generally
              manifests itself. &nbsp;Today was a day for the much calmer approach. &nbsp;</span>

          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">At the final turn-around point, at something like 30k, I could see that I had put time into the runner behind
              me, and started to feel confident about maintaining my position, although I knew that I was unlikely to catch
              the runner in front of me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d calculated that I was now in second place, although I found that
              hard to believe and almost discounted it and put it down to my brain playing tricks on me. &nbsp;That relative
              confidence did nothing to help prevent that final ten kilometre stretch from feeling like the longest forty
              minutes of my sporting life, where time and distance seemed to stand still. &nbsp;But step by step, every-so-slowly,
              the kilometre markers passed by, taking me closer to the goal - the goal that I have visualised during so many
              of my harder training sessions over the preceding nine months. &nbsp;Having made it as far as the turn into
              the finish chute without any major cramps, my hammies decided to cramp up with just a few hundred metres to
              go. &nbsp;</span>

          <p class="c3">
            <span class="c0">Anyone who knows me knows that I&rsquo;m not a shouter, but during those final steps down the finish chute, the
              raw emotion just flows out of my body. Emotion generated by ten hours of hard work and concentration, but more
              than that, emotions stemming from nine months of hard training, from the countless sacrifices made during that
              time, of the time spent reading Slowtwich forums (other forums are available!), of the late-night four-hour
              turbo trainer sessions finishing at 1 or 2am, then waking up at 6am to take care of family, of long runs in
              the driving rain when all you want to do is sit on the sofa and binge-watch your current Netflix favourite,
              of late-night swimming sessions in the pool with the woman who smells of insect repellent. &nbsp;The emotion
              that rendered me an incoherent, gibbering wreck as I was wheeled off to the medical tent after the finish</span>

            <span class="c0">My finish time of 9:49:40 was good enough on the day for second place overall. For the second year in a row,
              my marathon time of 3:11:34 snagged me the fastest run split of the day. 5:32:35 on the bike (I think including
              T2) got an me the fourth best bike split of the day, compared with only 26th fastest last year. &nbsp;Less
              impressive, as always, was my swim time of 1:05:31, which was only 68th overall. &nbsp;However, given that
              last year I only managed 109th place on the swim, at least I can see it trending in the right direction.</span>

              of &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; rears its ugly head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; as I know it always will,
              metamorphoses into &ldquo;Onwards and upwards,&rdquo; and looking at how to quality for my ultimate goal of

          <h3>Kyushu Sekiryo Trail Run in Yamatocho 2018 Race Report</h3>
          <p>I knew it had been quite a few years since I had done this race, but I didn’t know how many.  Facebook helpfully informed me that it had in fact been eight years since I did the race.  I’d like to think that I’ve improved significantly as a trail runner during that time, especially during the last two years when I’ve been running trails regularly two or three times a week.  And in all honestly, eight years ago I had precisely zero ability as a trail runner, so some improvement shouldn’t have been too hard to come by.  Eight years ago I was also terrified by the prospect of a 35k trail race with more than 2000m of ascending.  These days I generally feel unruffled before any race, with the exception of  my yearly A-race or two.
            Anyway, after a luxurious night of car camping in the race car park, I woke feeling refreshed and ready for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bang went the starter’s cannon (ok, more of a pop from a toy pistol) and we started running comfortably on a road section to the start of the trails, with me pottering along in around 15th position or so.  Problem number one arrived much sooner than anticipated, when we were directed onto a trail at around the 2km mark. Somehow - and I still don’t know how - we all missed a turn and ending up scrambling through a fallen bamboo forest, climbed over and squatting under fallen bamboo trees.  The general feeling in the group was that we must have missed a sign, and sure enough any semblance of a trail soon disappeared.  When we stopped and turned around, it was clear that most of the other runners had also missed the turn.  Most likely, the turn wasn’t marked, or we were directed onto the trail one turn too soon.  Anyway, after a five-minute scramble up a wooded slope, we were back on the road, and looking forward to the trails.  One of the joys of trail running!
        </p> 
        <p>
            After climbing around 1000m in the next 10k or so, I was ready to put my new descending skills to the test.  All was going swimmingly for a few ks, until I took the first of many falls.  The first one was a classic superman-esque affair, going close to full tilt down a perfectly innocuous easy slope.  Very little damage was done unfortunately, although more unfortunate was that no other runners were nearby to witness my incompetence!
            
            I followed this with at least another 5 or 6 falls.  A bad workman always blames his tools, and in this case I’m laying the blame squarely at the feet of my Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed shoes.  When new - just a mere 3 months ago - they had the best grip of any shoe I’ve ever used. Just three shorts months later, the sole lugs have worn down quite noticeably.  That’s my excuse anyway, and I’m sticking with it.  Anyway, to cut a long story short, and to word it in a way any other 1990s teenagers would get, I got up that day more than Chumbawamba did in Tubthumping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climbing the ski slope at Gokase and beginning the long descent back to the start marked the start of the technically most difficult part of the course for me.  A stretch of about 4km of loose rocks covered by grass and weeds - i.e. basically hidden rocks - proved to be very hard work for a runner of my trail running ability.
            
            A nice (for me) fast road descent, interspersed with slow and crampy (again, for me!) trail sections took me back to the finish line, and a finish time of 4:55:02, 9th place overall and 5th in the old buggers over 40s men category.  The winner was an astounding one hour and fifteen minutes faster than me.  There’s still a long way to go to become a better trail runner, and if I’m honest with myself, I’m never going to be an especially good trail runner.  But as a great aside during the triathlon off-season and way to build strength in my running legs, it’s something I’ll continue to enjoy doing.  I might even continue to test myself with the occasional race!
